# COURSE CONTENT



The course "VLSI Physical Design with ASIC" focuses on the practical aspects of designing and implementing integrated circuits using Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The course covers various stages of the physical design process, from logic synthesis to layout, with a focus on optimizing for performance, power efficiency, and manufacturability

## Concept  
RISC-V (pronounced "RISC Five") is an open and free instruction set architecture (ISA) designed for computer processors.

Several companies and organizations have embraced RISC-V for their processor designs, including both general-purpose processors and specialized accelerators. Some companies have released RISC-V-based processors for commercial use.

RISC-V processors operate by fetching, decoding, and executing instructions according to the RISC-V instruction set architecture. The simplicity and modularity of RISC-V instructions, along with the open nature of the architecture, make it a versatile choice for a wide range of processor implementations, from simple embedded devices to high-performance servers.
