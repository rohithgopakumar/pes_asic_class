# COURSE CONTENT



The course "VLSI Physical Design with ASIC" focuses on the practical aspects of designing and implementing integrated circuits using Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The course covers various stages of the physical design process, from logic synthesis to layout, with a focus on optimizing for performance, power efficiency, and manufacturability

 Introduction
### Flow : HLL -> ALP -> Binary -> (HDL) -> GDS
#### 1. HLL -> High level language (c , c++) 
- A high-level programming language is a type of programming language that is designed to be more human-readable and user-friendly compared to low-level languages like assembly or machine code.

#### 2. ALP -> Assembly level program
- Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to the architecture of a specific computer's central processing unit (CPU). Assembly language programs are written using mnemonic codes that represent specific machine instructions which the machine can understand.

#### 3. HDL -> Hardware Description Language
- It is a specialized programming language used for designing and describing digital hardware circuits. HDLs allow engineers to model and simulate complex digital systems before physical implementation, aiding in the design and verification of integrated circuits and FPGA configurations.
- Verilog, System Verilog, VHDL

#### 4. GDS -> Graphic Data System (l

## Errors faced
sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade

NOTE: if the config does not seem to function try locating the path and executing again

## Concept  
RISC-V (pronounced "RISC Five") is an open and free instruction set architecture (ISA) designed for computer processors.

Several companies and organizations have embraced RISC-V for their processor designs, including both general-purpose processors and specialized accelerators. Some companies have released RISC-V-based processors for commercial use.

RISC-V processors operate by fetching, decoding, and executing instructions according to the RISC-V instruction set architecture. The simplicity and modularity of RISC-V instructions, along with the open nature of the architecture, make it a versatile choice for a wide range of processor implementations, from simple embedded devices to high-performance servers.
